### ðŸŽ‰ 1st Place â€“ [Amazon's AWS Data Exchange Challenge Hackathon](https://awsdataexchange.devpost.com/)
**Introducing:** An interactive mapping tool that illustrates how certain demographicsâ€” including low-income communities, ethnic minorities, and immigrantsâ€” have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We're inviting you to explore the geography of this social justice issue with us, and learn how to combat it, as outbreaks evolve in real time.
